#TURTLE ANIMATIONS

This Repository is nothing really special, just some of the turtle animations i make when i am bored. I sometimes post them to youtube if i think they are good enough, so go check my youtube channel out https://youtube.com/@Bootleg_fish if you are interested. All libraries are preinstalled so nothing else is required :).
(And yes i know it is sphaghetti code, but it somehow works \__(* *)__/)
